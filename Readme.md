Getting the project up and running:

It should just run when cloned, but here is something if it breaks.

Used a Nuget called : X.PagedList.

All Serialkeys are in the SerialKeys.txt under Models.

There is no Submissions at this time, all needs to be setup, i will commit a SubmissionsTEST.txt later 
for easy testing of the project. Should be located in Model Aswell, just rename the file for easy testing.

Only Tested in Chrome Browser.


Future Improvements:

Create Interfaces for Submission.
Move SerialKeys and Submissions from model folder
Improve Data storage.
CleanUp code fra Start Template.
User Autentication.
Setup UnitTesting
